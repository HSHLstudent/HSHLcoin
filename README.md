What is HSHLcoin?
----------------

HSHLcoin is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 2.5 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 840k blocks (~4 years)
 - ~84 million total coins

The rest is the same as Bitcoin.

 - 2016 blocks to retarget difficulty

Development process
-------------------

HSHLCoin is a finished experiment, it works on Windows as well as on Linux and does just what you would expect a Litecoin-clone to do.



Installation on Windows
-----------------------
Just download the HSHLCoin-qt.exe and execute. It will automatically create a Wallet and an Address for you. Problem is that there is no existing Network in place for you to connect to. But worry not! You can just create your own! Just install the software on multiple PCÂ´s and create a HSHLCoin.conf file at C:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming\HSHLcoin. There you can add your other PCs' IP's with addnode="PC'sIP". That should do the trick.

Installation on Linux
---------------------
Just download the repo and execute HSHLCoin-qt. The other stuff is similar to the Windows-installation.
